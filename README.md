# _Restaurant Reviews_
Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - Restaurant Reviews Stage 1 Project.

### How to run this project?

To run this project, follow the steps:

1. Clone or download this project.

2. Locate and unzip the project file to a folder.

3. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, open the URL: `http://localhost:8000`.
